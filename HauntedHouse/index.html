          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you a fan of all things spooky and scary? If so,
            then you have come to the right place!<br><br>
            Feel the autumn chill as you find your way through our 5-acre corn maze!
             Keep an eye out for the scarecrow who watches over this cornfield; he 
             doesn’t take kindly to intruders!
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the trail into a lush forest and come to our scenic Black Lagoon. 
            If you look carefully, you may be lucky enough to see the creature who 
            lives here, but don’t venture too close to the water or you might become 
            his next meal!
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have found your way out of the trees, but you aren’t out of the 
            woods yet! Come upon the graveyard; the fog is thick so watch your step! 
            There may be more than branches grabbing at your feet.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a riot left it desolate. It is said to be inhabited by the ghosts 
            of former patients and staff, but none who have braved the asylum at night
             have returned to confirm or deny these rumors… Perhaps you will be able 
             to find out for yourself. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, find Dracula’s castle, as imposing and sinister as 
            the Count himself. Better hurry along, it’s best not to linger here in 
            the night. You never know what could be lurking around the next corner.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you made it to the end, congratulations! Be sure to come back next 
            year; our monsters are eager to see you again!
            </p>
